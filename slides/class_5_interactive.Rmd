## Learning outcomes

- Create a wide variety of interactive graphics using the `plotly` and `ggiraph` packages
- Learn the basics of `shiny`
- Create some animations (not really interactive but sometimes useful)

## Part 1: `plotly`

- A very rich package, but has the key advantage of one amazing function: `ggplotly`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(palmerpenguins)
p <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplotly(p)
```

## `ggplotly` plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(palmerpenguins)
p <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplotly(p)
```


## Some notes about `ggplotly`

- You can use `ggplotly` with more or less any `ggplot` that you have created
- However it doesn't work for every type of plot, and doesn't always show exactly what you want in the interactive elements
- There are extra options that will allow you to adjust what is shown in the `tooltip` which is the highlighted information when you hover your mouse over the plot

## Other ways of using `plotly`

- `plotly` also has its own syntax for creating individual plots

```{r}
plot_ly(data = penguins, x = ~bill_length_mm, 
        y = ~bill_depth_mm, color = ~sex, 
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers')
```

## Boxplots

```{r}
plot_ly(data = penguins, x = ~species, y = ~bill_depth_mm, type = 'box')
```

## 3D plots

```{r}
plot_ly(data = penguins, x = ~bill_length_mm, 
        y = ~bill_depth_mm, z = ~flipper_length_mm, 
        type = 'scatter3d', mode = 'markers')
```

## Final notes on `plotly`

- A very comprehensive support website at https://plotly.com/
- Versions for all the major data analytics languages
- A lot of overlap with `ggplot2`; though has never been quite as popular

## Part 2: `ggiraph`

- A more direct and controllable way of producing interactive graphs is using `ggiraph`
- Just replace `geom_X` with `geom_X_interactive`
- Can then control hover behaviour using `tooltip`, clicking behaviour using `onclick`, and the data behaviour using `data_id`

## `ggiraph` in use

```{r}
library(ggiraph)
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point_interactive()
girafe(p)
```

## Part 3: `shiny`

- The shiny package allows you to create beautiful GUIs which open and interact with an internet browser
- A shiny application involves (at least) two R functions. The first function, called `ui.R` contains the details of whatâ€™s actually going to appear on the webpage. The second, `server.R`, contains all the details of the R code that needs to be run
- The website https://shiny.rstudio.com contains some nice examples to get started
- See http://https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/ for some really impressive examples - bear in mind these are not particularly complicated to create

## `shiny` walkthrough

- Click `File > New File > Shiny Web App`
- Choose a name
- Click `Run App`


## Part 4: animations

The `animation` package contains functions which will turn static R plots into animations: gifs, html, swf, etc The general framework is:

1. Set the animation options using ani.options 
1. Put the animation frames for each plot in a loop
1. Call the ani.pause function to stop the animation running too fast
1. Wrap the above in a saveGIF/saveSWF/saveHTM function call to output to a file

(It's a bit like using the `pdf` and similar commands in base R plotting)

## `animation` example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(animation)
oopt = ani.options(interval = 0.2, nmax = 100)
for (i in 1:ani.options("nmax")) {
    plot(density(rnorm(10*i)),
         main = 10*i)
    ani.pause()
}
```

## ggplot animations with `gganimate`

Has special function called `transition_state` which works a little bit like `facet_wrap` but overlays the facets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  # Add an animation of the penguins' species over time
  transition_states(species, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +
  # Add a label for the current species
  labs(title = "Penguin species: {closest_state}")
```

## More `gganimate`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```


## Final words on gganimate

- Great manual/website at https://gganimate.com
- Lots of different transition functions for all kinds of different functionality
- Loads of other different functions for behaviour of background data, movements between frames, scale changes, aesthetic changes, etc
- Can output the files in a gif or other movie file using the `animate` function

## Exercise

- 


## Summary

- `plotly` is the way to start if you just want to create a simple animation from a `ggplot`. If you want more control use `ggiraph`
- Use `shiny` for full dashboard control of plots and any other R feature. A whole other course required to understand this fully
- `gganimate` a great package for creating animations (though also see plotly which can add a play button)
