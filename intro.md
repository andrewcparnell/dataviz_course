# 2 day course: Introduction to Data Visualisation using R

## About

This course will cover the basics of data visualisation for understanding and interpreting data sets. The course will the basic principals of visualisation and provide students with the necessary tools to create appropriate graphics for their data sets. The course will include both standard lectures, guided coding sessions, and self-guided practical exercises. 

The course will run using the R programming language, with a focus on the ggplot2 package and its extensions. The first day covers many of the basics of this approach, whilst the second day covers extensions into higher dimensional data analysis, interactive visualisations, and visualising statistical and machine learning model output.  

The course matertial was developed in collaboration with Dr Catherine Hurley at Maynooth University. 

## Intended audience

Research postgraduates, practicing academics, or other professionals from any field who would like to learn about data visualisation. 

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have :

 - Some familiarity with R including the ability to import/export data, manipulate data frames, fit basic statistical models, and generate simple exploratory and diagnostic plots.
  - A laptop/personal computer with a working version or R and RStudio installed. R and RStudio are supported by both PC and Mac and can be downloaded for free by following these links: [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
